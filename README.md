# Pallavi's Portfolio

I’m **Pallavi Pareek**, a Data Scientist with over 3 years of experience working across data analytics, data engineering, and applied data science in enterprise and academic environments. I’ve had the opportunity to work with organizations such as Airbus Group India, KLN Advisory Services, and the University of North Texas Libraries, where I built and optimized ETL/ELT pipelines, analytics-ready datasets, and production database solutions using Python and advanced SQL.

My work focuses on hypothesis-driven analysis, statistical investigation, and root cause analysis, turning complex, multi-source data into actionable insights and reliable KPIs. I enjoy designing Power BI and Tableau dashboards, automating analytics workflows, and building data models that improve accuracy, efficiency, and decision-making. I’m especially interested in projects that sit at the intersection of data, experimentation, and business impact.

I thrive in collaborative environments where data storytelling matters just as much as technical rigor, and I enjoy communicating insights to both technical teams and business stakeholders. I’m currently seeking early-career Data Scientist, BI Analyst, or Data Engineer roles, and I’m open to relocation.
